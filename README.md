## About me
Interested in __Machine Learning__ (ML) and __Reinforcement Learning__ (RL) _multi-task and meta-rl in particular_ and have some experience with robotic perception.
My life in bulletpoints:

- 2022: __Machine learning engineer__ @[HappyScribe](https://www.happyscribe.com/), working on automatic speech recognition.
- 2021: __Machine learning engineer intern__ @[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), implemented a two-stage recommender system to improve search results.
- 2021: __Machine learning engineer intern__ @[EA Games](https://www.ea.com/), researched on multi-task RL to improve automatic game-testing.
- 2020: __Teacher assistant__ @[KTH Advanced Machine Learning course](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2434?l=en), teached ML [fundamentals](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf).
- 2019: __Research engineer__ @[Robotics Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439), developed a vision module for robotic pick-and-place.
- 2019: **M.Sc. student** @[M.Sc. in Machine Learning](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en).
- 2018: __Perception engineer__ @[XYZ Robotics](http://en.xyzrobotics.ai/), worked on robotic pick-and-place [applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpAhksAeqU4&ab_channel=XYZRobotics).
- 2017: __Research student__ @[MCube Lab](https://fme.upc.edu/en) in the [(MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/), explored ML computer vision for robotic tactile feedback.
- 2013: **B.Sc. student:** Simultaneously studied a [B.Sc. in Mathematics](https://fme.upc.edu/en) and a [B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering](https://etseib.upc.edu/en) through [CFIS](https://cfis.upc.edu/en) center at the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/en).
